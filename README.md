## Goals

### Business Goals

* Launch a fully functional responsive web MVP for the hackathon, demonstrating seamless group trip coordination.  
* Validate demand by targeting 10+ active groups using the platform post-hackathon.  
* Garner positive user feedback (80%+ satisfaction rate from initial testers). “Easier than building a Google Sheet”

### User Goals

* Enable fast and clear setup of shared trips, minimizing confusion in group coordination.  
* Ensure every participant has visibility into itineraries and costs.  
* Centralize trip communication and planning so nothing is lost across multiple channels.  
* Make managing group expenses easy and transparent, reducing manual calculation and platform-hopping.  
* Create a delightful, inclusive experience—no one left out or overwhelmed.

### Non-Goals

* Supporting enterprise-grade features (e.g., complex permissions, API for third-party vendors).  
* Deep, custom travel booking integrations (airfare, hotels) for MVP.  
* In-app real-time chat (beyond pragmatic comment threads within trip content).  
* Integrations with payment apps such as Splitwise for MVP.

## User Stories

**Persona 1:** “The Planner” (e.g., Jess—Organizational Enthusiast, takes charge of details)

* As a Planner, I want to create a new group trip and add all participants, so that everyone is on the same page from the start.  
* As a Planner, I want to pre-fill dates and suggest initial accommodation options, so the group can weigh in.  
* As a Planner, I want to track each participant’s RSVP and availability, so no one is scheduled for days they can't attend.  
* As a Planner, I want to assign activities/meals to participants, so the work of organizing is shared.  
* As a Planner, I want to review all trip costs by person, so I can keep the group’s budget balanced.

**Persona 2:** “The Busy Joiner” (e.g., Alex—Wants involvement but limited time)

* As a Joiner, I want an easy way to sign in and see all my upcoming trips, so I never lose track.  
* As a Joiner, I want to quickly update my availability, so the group has accurate info.  
* As a Joiner, I want to view the trip’s accommodations, activities, and meals, so I am prepared and feel included.  
* As a Joiner, I want to see exactly what I owe (and pay it easily), so I’m never surprised by costs.

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

* When opening the app, user (the planner) lands into a welcome screen with two options either to create a trip or to access to their account if they already have one  
* The User creating a trip is guided through naming, date selection, and number of participants.  
* A dashboard is created with a Default, playful AI-generated image for the trip at the top. User (the planner) can start building the trip. The dashboard has three buttons: add accommodation, add an activity and add a meal/food (modules)  
* As the planner inputs accommodations, activities and meals, the dashboard displays the itinerary broken by day and modules  
* Once the planner has added 3-5 modules , a micro-interaction pops up to encourage the planner to invite friends to collaborate/or share the trips with friends.   
* If the user confirms, then they are invited to create a profile (account) and then to add the emails of their friends


  
**Core Experience**

* Step 1: User selects a trip from “My Trips.”  
  * Clean dashboard with participant bubbles and trip details up top.  
  * UI echoes across devices for ease of use.  
* Step 2: Review and manage participant info.  
  * Each participant can edit their travel dates and avatar/image.  
  * Visual date range displayed; updates in real-time for everyone.  
* Step 3: Drill into trip content: Accommodations, Activities, Meals.  
  * Each section contains a sortable, additive list of items.  
  * Rich item entry: Description (unlimited), date, location, relevant participants.  
  * Costs auto-calculated and displayed per item; participant cost auto-updated.  
* Step 4: Cost Management  
  * Current total owed per participant visible in header/footer.  
* Step 5: Collaboration features  
  * Any participant can add items, suggest edits, or reorder plans.  
  * Light in-line commenting for discussion (no real-time chat for MVP).

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

* Error handling: If a participant’s date range doesn’t cover a scheduled item, prompt to adjust.  
* Handling trip overflows (more than, e.g., 12 participants shown as \+N bubble).

**UI/UX Highlights**

* High-contrast, intuitive icons/buttons and universal navigation.  
* Consistent experience: trip management flows identical across web and apps.  
* Clean, mobile-friendly layout with day-by-day trip breakdown  
* Participant avatars shown in circles with initials or images  
* Smooth, intuitive add/edit flow with modals  
* Real-time updates when trip is modified

## Narrative

Jess, the go-to planner in her friend group, is done juggling spreadsheets. She opens the app, creates a trip, adds trip name, dates, and starts entering activities that all her friends have already agreed on during the last potluck. After 2–3 entries, she invites friends via link or email. Alex, who’s busy at work, joins from the link, immediately sees the trip’s essentials: who’s coming, the exact dates, and the latest plan for cabins, hikes, and shared dinners, and adds his favorite hike. Everyone contributes—no confusion, no stress

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

* Modern web front end (mobile-first design)  
* Simple back-end for authentication, trip, participant, and content data; role-based access for privacy.

### Data Storage & Privacy

* Store all content in secure, privacy-compliant storage (encrypted personal info, images, audit logs).  
* Restrict trip data visibility to authenticated, added participants only.  
* Simple “delete my account/data” option in product.

### Scalability & Performance

* Designed to comfortably handle 10–20 active trips/groups concurrently in MVP.  
* Lightweight, efficient app for quick loading and offline-resilient UI for mobile.

### Potential Challenges

* Cross-platform UX consistency with small engineering team.
