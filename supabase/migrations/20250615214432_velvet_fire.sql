/*
  # Fix infinite recursion in trip_participants RLS policy

  1. Problem
    - The current RLS policy on trip_participants creates infinite recursion
    - Policy tries to query trip_participants table within its own USING clause
    - This causes "infinite recursion detected in policy" error

  2. Solution
    - Simplify the policy to use direct user_id check for own participation records
    - Use trips table RLS to control which trips are accessible
    - Remove circular dependency by not querying trip_participants within its own policy

  3. Security
    - Users can see their own participation records directly
    - Trip access is controlled by trips table RLS policies
    - Maintains security while eliminating recursion

-- Drop the problematic policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can read trip participants for their trips" ON trip_participants;

-- Create a simpler, non-recursive policy
-- Users can see trip participants for trips they have access to
-- This relies on the trips table RLS to determine trip access
CREATE POLICY "Users can read trip participants for accessible trips"
  ON trip_participants

  USING (
    -- User can see participants if they can access the trip

      SELECT id FROM trips
      -- The trips table RLS will handle the access control
